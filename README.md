# traefik-plugin-header


If Traefik is behind a load balancer, it won't be able to get the Real IP from the external client by checking the remote IP address.

This plugin solves this issue by overwriting the X-Real-Ip with an IP from the X-Forwarded-For or Cf-Connecting-Ip (if from Cloudflare) header. The real IP will be the first one that is not included in any of the CIDRs passed as the ExcludedNets parameter. The evaluation of the X-Forwarded-For or Cf-Connecting-Ip (if from Cloudflare) IPs will go from the last to the first one.
